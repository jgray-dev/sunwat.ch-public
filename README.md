# Sunwat.ch

### A new way to view the sun

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

#### Local page - shows rating for your current location - or anywhere in the world you'd like to search

- Autocomplete search box for locations around the world
- Shows a live webcam of the location you search - or the nearest webcam at least
- Color coordinated ratings and values when displaying data (red bad, green good!)

#### World page - shows ratings and webcams hand selected from around the world!

- Will only show webcams that have a sunrise or sunset in the next 5 hours
- Shows ratings and all data for each location
- Webcam shows timelapse of last 24hours

#### Gallery page

- A place users can upload pictures of the sunrise or sunset!
- Automatically inputs all data in the form, and prompts the user for comments and an image
- Automatically uploads images and json to a remote server (running PHP) to be fetched later
- **actually works lol**

#### Changelog

- Simple place I can POST/GET data from a remote server containing changes I make to the website
- Easy to understand, visually nice
